# 3Dprinting
An instructional, step-by-step guide to building my version of the popular Hypercube printer, which can be found at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766. Tech2C (the original creator) does a great job of setting a foundation that I've modified and improved upon and created a guide to augment his. I'd recommend reading his guide and watching his videos first, and then reading this one to get a deeper understanding of its mechanical function as well as modifications and improvements that can be made. A **quick disclaimer**: as of today, desktop 3D printers have achieved such high quality for their price that building one will not only be more expensive, but also likely result in a poorer product. To me and many other makers, however, it is definitely more fun to build one yourself, but if you're just looking to get started printing without much effort I'd recommend buying a printer.

## Getting Started
The first part of any build is to buy all the parts! A full parts list can be found at the thingiverse link, but lets take some time to properly understand what even we're buying and what each part does. We'll start with the printed parts, since those are probably the hardest ones to source.

Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to build a 3D printer without access to 3D printer to fabricate many of the needed brackets, mounts, and gantries. The full list of printed parts needed can be found at the thingiverse link, but if 3D printing is a concern, there are a lot of shortcuts that you can get away with. In my personal design, I found it easier to buy a $15 dollar extruder from Amazon, which removes the need for printing the three Bowden parts. If you're willing to make liberal use of duct tape, there are many other parts that you could shortcut, including:

1. Z, X, Y endstops: In a pinch you can glue or tape the endstops on without the need for a printed mount
2. Sensor mounts: A inductive sensor is a bit of a luxury, since automatic bed leveling isn't a must to print parts
3. Z endstop adjust: This can be emulated with glueing or taping a screw on your bed. (This'll become obvious later)
4.
